<h1>Headline</h1>
<h2>Subhead</h2>
<p>This is normal text, set 5 picas wide in 12/14 Times Roman.
I even allow some <em>emphasised term,</em> set in Times-Italic. The TeX
hyphenation algorithm is also implemented.
I have also some <em>cursive text</em> and an example of
an Erlang term. The term <code>{person, \"Joe\"}</code> is an Erlang term.
The variable <code>X</code>, was immediately followed by
a comma. The justification algorithm does proper <em>kerning</em>,
which is more than <em>Microsoft Word</em> can do. AWAY again is
correctly kerned! Erlang terms <code>{like, this}</code>
are typeset in <em>courier.</em></p>
